Game Ideas:

- Small 2d horror game where you're a square trying to escape from other, monstrous shapes (with jumpscares and sound?).

-"3D" maze where you can move from one side of a cube to another

-"Move or Die" style platformer

-"3d" dungeon where you move forward/backward/left/right instead of up/down/left/right. Has a mini map and monsters.
